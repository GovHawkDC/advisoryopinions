The rules for regular and special Government employees are covered in one document, and the rules for noncareer employees and Presidential appointees are addressed in a second document. \n\nNotes: [Note: Among other changes to the Standards of Conduct effective August 15, 2024, OGE restructured the \u201ccompensation\u201d definition in 2635.807(a)(2)(iii). No substantive changes were made, but this restructuring has rendered inaccurate some citations in this document relating to the compensation definition. See 89 FR 43686 and LA-24-06.]"}
