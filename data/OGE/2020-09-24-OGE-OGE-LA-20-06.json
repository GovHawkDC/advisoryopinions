Specifically, this Advisory shares guidance provided by OGE since 2008 relating to the ability of employees, during government service, to: (1) receive compensation for updating a textbook or other book that was initially written prior to government service; (2) engage in promotional activities as part of a book deal; and (3) try to sell a book idea or \u201cshop a book around.\u201d \n\nNotes: [Note: Among other changes to the Standards of Conduct effective August 15, 2024, OGE restructured the \u201ccompensation\u201d definition in 2635.807(a)(2)(iii). No substantive changes were made, but this restructuring has rendered inaccurate some citations in this document relating to the compensation definition. See 89 FR 43686 and LA-24-06.]"}
